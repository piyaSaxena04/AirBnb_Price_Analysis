# AirBnb_Price_Analysis
# Problem statement
Based on the data we try to find out and make a analysis of the dataset of booking details

Like we have to find correlation between different variables. To see what are the traffic distance among different areas and what is the reason behind it. And to make analysis of which host charges the higher price, which host is busiest and what is the reason. what can we learn about different hosts and areas.
# Summary of the project
Since 2008, guests and hosts have used Airbnb to expand on travelling possibilities and present a more unique, personalised way of experiencing the world. Today, Airbnb became one of a kind service that is used and recognized by the whole world. Data analysis on millions of listings provided through Airbnb is a crucial factor for the company. These millions of listings generate a lot of data - data that can be analysed and used for security, business decisions, understanding of customers' and providers' (hosts) behaviour and performance on the platform, guiding marketing initiatives, implementation of innovative additional services and much more.

This dataset has around 49,000 observations in it with 16 columns and it is a mix of categorical and numeric values.
In summary, the examination of Airbnb booking data yields significant insights into user booking behaviors and preferences. By scrutinizing variables such as room type, neighborhood, and pricing, a comprehensive understanding of trends and patterns emerges, offering Airbnb actionable intelligence to refine their business strategy and enhance user satisfaction.

The analysis reveals that entire apartments are the most sought-after room type, followed by private rooms and shared rooms. Notably, Manhattan and Queens stand out as the most popular neighborhoods, boasting the highest number of listings per host. Moreover, a positive correlation between the number of reviews and booking prices underscores the willingness of guests to invest more in listings of superior quality.

In essence, this analysis equips Airbnb with valuable information to make informed, data-driven decisions for optimizing their business strategy and elevating the overall user experience. By aligning with user booking preferences, Airbnb can strategically allocate resources, maximize revenue, and foster an improved experience for both hosts and guests.
